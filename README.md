# Hydration React

This repo contains examples of how React uses hydration and rendering. This is purely for educational purposes. The ideal state is to have a very fast and optimal React application.

## Getting Started

There are 2 folders, related to the approach being SSR or CSR.

- client
- server

## Prerequisites

You have worked with React or know what it is. If not, please check [React](https://react.dev/).

## Scripts

There are numourous scripts to run the application. The most important ones are:

- `npm run dev` - This will run the application in development mode
- `npm run build` - This will build the application
- `npm run start` - This will run the application in production mode

## Disclaimer

Most of these use cases are not something you will be using, this is a peek at what frameworks like Remix, NextJS, Gatsby, etc. are doing under the hood.
